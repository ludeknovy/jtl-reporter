```
* Dump all of your data by running:
```
docker exec -t <container_name> pg_dumpall -a -U postgres > backup_v3.sql
```

* Import the data to v4 DB (make sure the DB is up):

## Analytics 
Currently, the following metrics are collected:
 * every 6 hours the backend application sends an event that the instance is alive
 * report processing is finished
 * the number of labels and duration of the test run
 
 If you don't want the analytics to be used, you can set `OPT_OUT_ANALYTICS` to `true` for backend service.
Mixpanel service is used for storing the data.
